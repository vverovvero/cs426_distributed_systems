Lab3, Wendy Chen															12/2016

Implementation details:
//Installed grpc on Linux VM hosted on Google Cloud.
//Making the proto file only works assuming grpc has been correctly installed.
//grpc has dependendencies beyond these files in the lab.  Grpc has been installed
//at ~/grpc.

//Mongoose used in this lab has no known dependencies beyond the included files.

In this lab, a chain of vm nodes has been set up:

Chain Position	| VM name	| External IP 	| http port 	| grpc port 	|
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
head			instance-1	104.198.165.44	 7080			  8080
middle			instance-2  104.154.198.82   7090			  8090
tail			instance-3  104.154.145.208  8000			  9000


On each node, all executables have been made.  If not made, just run 'make' 
in the directory: /lab3

To start each server:

instance-1:
./cs426_graph_server -b 8080 7080

instance-2: 
./cs426_graph_server -b 8090 7090

instance-3:
./cs426_graph_server -b 9000 8000


Write requests should only be made to instance-1.
e.g. curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"node_id":1}' http://104.198.165.44:7080/api/v1/add_node

Read requests can be made to any of the instances:
eg. curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"node_id":1}' http://104.198.165.44:7080/api/v1/get_neighbors
eg. curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"node_id":1}' http://104.154.198.82:7090/api/v1/get_neighbors
eg. curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"node_id":1}' http://104.154.145.208:8000/api/v1/get_neighbors
